# Hirst Spot Painting Program

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library and the colorgram library to create a digital version of a spot painting inspired by Damien Hirst. The spots are randomly colored and arranged in a grid pattern.

## Features

Utilizes the Turtle graphics library for drawing.  
Extracts colors from an image using the colorgram library.  
Randomly assigns colors to spots from the extracted color palette.  
Draws a grid of spots on the screen.

## How to Use

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:  
`pip install PythonTurtle`  
`pip install colorgram.py`  
Replace the "Hirst-spot-painting.png" file with your own image or use the provided image.  
Run the Python script.  
`python main.py`  
A Turtle graphics window will open, and the program will draw a grid of randomly colored spots on the screen.  
Click on the Turtle graphics window to close it.

## Customization

You can adjust the number of colors extracted from the image by changing the value in the "extract" function.  
Modify the number of rows and columns in the spot grid by adjusting the loop conditions and the "forward" function parameters.  

Feel free to experiment with different images, color palettes, and grid configurations to create your own unique digital spot painting.
